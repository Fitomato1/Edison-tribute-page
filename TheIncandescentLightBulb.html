          An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light
          globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated until it glows.
          The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb with a vacuum or inert gas to
          protect the filament from oxidation. Current is supplied to the
          filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket
          provides mechanical support and electrical connections.

          Incandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light
          output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They
          require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing
          costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct
          current. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in
          household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table
          lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and
          advertising lighting.

          Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than other types of
          electric lighting, converting less than 5% of the energy they use into
          visible light. The remaining energy is lost as heat. The luminous
          efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb for 120 V operation is 16
          lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb
          or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications use the heat
          generated by the filament. Heat lamps are made for uses such as
          incubators, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Quartz tube
          halogen infrared heaters are used for industrial processes such as
          paint curing or for space heating.

          Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other
          types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus
          typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 20,000–30,000
          hours for lighting LEDs. Incandescent bulbs can be replaced by
          fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, and light-emitting
          diode lamps (LED). Some areas have implemented phasing out the use of
          incandescent light bulbs to reduce energy consumption.
