          Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an
          American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's
          greatest inventor. He developed many devices in fields such as
          electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and
          motion pictures. Born: Thomas Alva Edison; February 11, 1847
          Occupation: Inventor, businessman These inventions, which include the
          phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the
          electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern
          industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the
          principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of
          invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established
          the first industrial research laboratory. Edison was raised in the
          American Midwest; early in his career he worked as a telegraph
          operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he
          established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey,
          where many of his early inventions were developed. He later
          established a botanic laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in
          collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and
          a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's
          first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor,
          holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other
          countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in
          1931 of complications of diabetes.
