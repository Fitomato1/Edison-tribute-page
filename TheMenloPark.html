          Edison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial
          research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan
          Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) in Middlesex County,
          New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex
          telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not
          sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right,
          so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them
          offer $10,000 ($226,000 in today's dollars[28]), which he gratefully
          accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial
          success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the
          specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and
          improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions
          produced there, though many employees carried out research and
          development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry
          out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to
          produce results.

          William Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started
          working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in
          December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone,
          phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting,
          and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on
          the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and
          records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of
          Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer
          of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general
          manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to
          Edison, Hammer was "a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting".
          Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer,
          was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization
          in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at
          Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the
          common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his
          notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis
          conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for
          example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting
          system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's
          Law and economics.
